## Current Implementation
So far the fretboard is displayed with standard EADGBE tuning using sharps as default. There are options to pick some of the provided tunings or to input a new tuning. 

## Problems to solve
1. The color scheme I am not crazy about. It is a little hard to read so there must be some changes to the color scheme.
2. There should be guitar strings running through the board to increase readability. The strings should probably be numbered as well.
3. Better error feedback. There is some implemented here but I think it could be better.
4. When the options change, it sometimes is hard to tell it changed. There needs to be more distinct color schemes for tunings I think.
